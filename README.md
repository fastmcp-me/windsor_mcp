# Windsor MCP Server

Windsor MCP (Model Context Protocol) enables your LLM to query, explore, and analyze your full-stack business data integrated into Windsor.ai with zero SQL writing or custom scripting.  
It connects seamlessly to 325+ platforms, giving AI-native tools such as Claude, Perplexity, Cursor, or others, real-time access to your performance marketing, sales, and customer data to help you unlock valuable insights.

## 🌟 Features

### Natural language access to business data  
Windsor MCP is a natural language interface that connects your integrated Windsor.ai datasets with the LLM platform, enabling you to better understand your data by asking questions like:
- “What campaigns had the best ROAS last month?”
- “Give me a breakdown of spend by channel over the past 90 days.”
- “What campaigns are wasting our advertising budget?”

All in real-time, directly inside your LLM chat interface.

### Out-of-the-box integration with 325+ sources  
Sync data from Facebook Ads, GA4, HubSpot, Salesforce, Shopify, TikTok Ads, and more via native Windsor.ai connectors.

### Zero-code setup  
Windsor MCP works via the Claude Desktop or with a lightweight dev proxy. No custom integrations required.

### Open standard compatibility  
Built on Anthropic’s open MCP spec, it’s compatible with Claude, Perplexity, Cursor, and more.

### Real-time Analytics without SQL  
Get instant breakdowns, summaries, and performance insights from your integrated data.

## 🎯 How It Works

You connect Windsor MCP to your preferred LLM as an external connector using the MCP protocol. The LLM can then issue real-time data queries and receive structured results, all within the chat interface.

### Example prompts:
- What was total ad spend by channel last month?
- Break down ROAS for Meta vs Google Ads for Q2
- Are there any campaigns overspending vs target ROAS?
